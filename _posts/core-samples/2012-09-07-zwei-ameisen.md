#Die Ameisen  


> In Münster lebten zwei Ameisen,  
> Die wollten nach Australien reisen.  
> Bei Altona auf der Chaussee  
> Da taten ihnen die Beine weh,  
> Und da verzichteten sie weise  
> Dann auf den letzten Teil der Reise.

#The Ants  

> There once were two ants in Münster (Westphalia)  
> who wanted to visit Australia.  
> But when they crossed the Hammer Street,  
> they noticed a growing pain in their feet.  
> And reasonably, as both were as shrewd,  
> 'twas the rest of the journey that they did exclude.

But, unlike the two ants, we did not spare the remaining 16,484km. Hence, this is the first post in the brand new down-under blog, we're glad you found it.  
In the following weeks and months, we will leave our footprints here in the sand, most of them manifested in words or pictures.
